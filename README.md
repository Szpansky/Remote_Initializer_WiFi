# Remote_Initializer_WiFi


WiFi Initializer
My latest project fully invented by me. I fully created 3D design of the case, and also the main high current control board for that project.

Description in progress...



## How it started

The idea had started from card box, used switches, one esp32 chip, tranzistor and some additional electric components.

## It works

### My own case
After prototype I started to creating my own box. I used 3D blender to create my model. Model was printed in 3D printer

### Improved Electronic, with more outputs and higher Current output.
After working set, I also started to improve my main board, to have more oututs, and to have more stable outputs.

## How it works
In that example I used high resistant wire, to ignite standart match.

During test with fireworks, I used redy to connect, firework igniters.

## What's next

That project use modified tasmota software when comes to the esp32 module. Thanks to that it can be easily used in your HomeAssistant environment or any other project f.e with MQTT.
My solution here was to automate my fireworks presentation. To focus only on watching with my family :)
Soon on sale in the store ;)
